# 100s-archive-feed

Provides a RSS feed with the latest episode per day of the "tagesschau in 100 Sekunden" podcast[1].

Available at:
```
https://r2binx.github.io/100s-archive-feed/feed.xml
```


## Why?

Their feed only always contains a single episode. This doesn't play nicely if your podcast app automatically downloads episodes but you want to be able to listen to past episodes.

This feed will provide the metadata for the latest[2] episode of each day.

Shoutout to [audiobookshelf](https://audiobookshelf.org/) and [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)!
