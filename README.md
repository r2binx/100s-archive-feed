# 100s-archive-feed

Provides a RSS feed with the metadata for all episodes of the "tagesschau in 100 Sekunden" podcast[1].

Available at:
```
https://r2binx.github.io/100s-archive-feed/feed.xml
```


## Why?

Their feed only always contains a single episode. This doesn't play nicely if your podcast app automatically downloads episodes but you want to be able to listen to past episodes.

Shoutout to [audiobookshelf](https://audiobookshelf.org/) and [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)!
